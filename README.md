# Vultisig Verifier

A service providing threshold signature scheme (TSS) operations for vaults. Works with [Vultisig Plugins](https://github.com/vultisig/plugin) to process and sign blockchain transactions.

## Features

- Vault management (create, retrieve, manage)
- TSS operations with DKLS
- Transaction processing
- Policy enforcement
- Asynchronous processing

## Architecture

- **Core Components**: API server, Worker service, PostgreSQL/Redis storage
- **Integration**: Receives transactions from Plugins, processes them securely
- **Security Model**: Plugins handle business logic; Verifier manages cryptographic operations

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24.2+, PostgreSQL 14+, Redis 6+, Docker

### Quick Start
```bash
# create a shared network for docker containers
docker network create shared_network
# start verifier and worker in docker compose
make up

# seed the postgres database with initial data
make seed-db

# run frontend marketplace locally
make run-frontend
```

To debug Docker containers in GoLand with breakpoints, [refer to this article](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/attach-to-running-go-processes-with-debugger.html).

For convenient usage of debug breakpoints in GoLand, you can start only infra/db with Docker, and backend services outside Docker. Configs shared in `.run` directory, all envs already configured correctly. It will run:
- Verifier Server (don't forget to set `http://localhost:8081` instead of `http://payroll-server:8080` in `plugins` table);
- Verifier Worker;
- Tx Indexer Worker;
- Plugins Frontend;

How to install dev version of Chrome extension from desired branch:

- Clone [vultisig-windows](https://github.com/vultisig/vultisig-windows) repo and checkout to desired branch;
- `yarn install` to install deps;
- `yarn run build-extension` to build Chrome extension files;
- Open Chrome and load extension there:
  - Open `chrome://extensions`;
  - Click `Developer mode` toggle at top-right;
  - Click `Load unpacked`;
  - Select `vultisig-windows/clients/extension/dist` folder;
  - Now you'll see Vultisig Extension at the extensions list;

To switch branch or update it: rebuild code and click `Reload` button near Vultisig Extension at the extensions list â€” Chrome would reload files from the same path;
